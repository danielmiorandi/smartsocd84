The vision of the SmartSociety platform is to become an `IFTTT~\footnote{{\tt https://ifttt.com/}: IFTTT (IF This Then That) is a Web-based service allowing non-technical users to create chains of conditional statements (called `IF recipes') and actions (called `DO recipes') involving popular Web services.} for social computation', i.e., a platform that allows the easy integration of hybrid (human and machine) computational elements within the scope of a well-defined application workflow. While various steps have been taken in this direction, the overarching goal will require intense activities for the remainder of the project. 

Version 2.0 of the SmartSociety platform integrates seven key components: peer manager, orchestration manager, communication middleware, provenance service, reputation service, monitoring and analysis service and application runtime. This configuration is sufficient for developing a number of different applications using various types of social computation. Some limitations in terms of the single components are expected to be overcome with refinements from the relevant technical WP.

In terms of the upcoming steps, four major components to be integrated are the context manager (which will interact strictly with the peer manager), the reputation maanager, the task execution manager and the incentive server. Major changes in the platform configuration will come from the delivery of the programming framework by WP7 (foreseen at M36), which will have a major impact on how platform functionality can be accessed by application developers. Interactions with the virtual gamified environment in WP9 may also lead to a refactoring of some of the features exposed by the platform. Another major release of the platform is foreseen at M36. 

\todo{Taken from D1.2}
There is here an interesting element related to the deployment (and business) model of the platform. If the platform is made available 'as a service', indeed, the platform controller can exercise some form of control, for example by means of a code of conduct (formalised through, e.g., terms and conditions for the usage of the platform services). This could be use to perform some control on what the platform is used for, and eventually ban some applications which are deemed not in line with the ethical principles of the SmartSociety project. On the other hand by providing the platform as an open-source server that anybody can setup and deploy there are no means to enforce any form of control, so that the platform could, at least theoretically, be used for managing and operating 'evil' (read it: discriminatory, non democratic etc.) HDA- CASs. There is therefore a tension here, in that both models bring about advantages and disadvantages, which should be properly balanced. 
%In line with the DoW, the actual internal release of the first version of the platform (including user modules) represents MS18 and is due at M27. By M27 the integration roadmap foresees the integration of the provenance store and of the reputation manager. It will further include a fi5rst version of the execution manager and of the monitoring and analysis service. Security and privacy aspects will be integrated during the third year of the project, in particular within the scope of WP4 (where all personal information is stored). The programming framework development will be strictly aligned with the platform functionality enhancement and will support the easy registration and deployment of applications. The context manager will be integrated with the peer manager in the course of 2015. The incentives manager will be integrated in a later stage of the project, the actual integration date depending on the progress of research activities within WP5. Further work will be carried out in a dialogue with WP1 in terms of devising mechanisms supporting various governance models for the platform. Last, but not least, the development of the platform will also reflect the work on exploitation plans and potential business models carried out within the scope of WP10.

%The second platform prototype (including validation results from lab experiments) will be delivered as D8.3 at M30. 

% In this deliverable we have introduced:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item An analysis of requirements for the SmartSociety platform, elicited by working in  cooperation with the other work packages and covering both functional and non-functional properties. 
% \item A system-level architecture, encompassing:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the definition of the logical and functional role of each platform component;
% \item a definition of the interactions among components;
% \item the preliminary identification of modules within each component, in line with the progress of single technical WPs.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% This document represents the starting point for the integration activities taking place in the second year of the project (T8.2 and T8.3). The overall architecture will be iteratively revised, improved and extended during the second year of the project, leading to the delivery, at M24, of a first prototypical implementation of the platform. D8.1 will
% serve as reference document and handbook for the development and prototyping activities to be carried out within WP2-WP7, defining clearly the role of the respective components in the overall platform architecture and the interaction patterns with other components. The architecture will be maintained as a living reference document; the release of the first prototype at M24 will go hand in hand with the provisioning of a revised architectural specification, accounting for the evolution of perspectives during year-2.

% Last, it is worth remarking that WP8 played an important {\it integration}
% role in the first year of activities of the SmartSociety project. In order to reach
% a consistent view on the architecture of the SmartSociety platform, indeed,
% WP8 established and fostered an active and open discussion among the
% technical WPs (WP2-WP7). The agreement reached among WPs in terms of logical role, functionalities of their components, and interaction patterns represents an important contribution of WP8 in year-1.
