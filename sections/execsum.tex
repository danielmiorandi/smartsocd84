The SmartSociety platform represents a toolbox for easily and quickly building applications and services executing hybrid, diversity-aware forms of social computation. The toolbox includes eight components, each one performing a well-defined functionality and accessible through REST APIs. Functionality exposed by the components can be accessed by means of a set of programmer-friendly primitives, which are supported by a purposefully developed runtime library. 

The core components of the toolbox are released as open source form under a liberal licensing scheme, allowing researchers, Web entrepreneurs and startup companies to quickly prototype, deploy and experiment with applications and services enabling augmented collectives.

This report describes the final version of the SmartSociety platform, which integrates the instantiation of the components designed and developed by the Consortium members within the framework of the technical workpackages WP2-WP7.
