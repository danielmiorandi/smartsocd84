\subsection{Peer Manager}
\subsubsection{Functionality and Features}
The Peer Manager (PM) is a fundamental building block of the SmartSociety platform, providing a peer-centered data store that maintains and manages information about human- or machine-based peers within a privacy-preserving framework.
2.1 Mechanisms and algorithms
The PM was designed as an extension of the notion of existing identity management sys- tems3, with the objective of keeping the information owned by peers private. In order to provide a flexible management of information, the PM builds upon the notion of an entity-centric semantic enhanced model that defines an extensible set of entity schemas providing the templates for an attribute-based representation of peersâ€™ characteristics [2]. Additionally, the PM defines a storage and privacy protection model by adding privacy reg- ulations and considerations [3]. The design of this model pays special attention to different privacy issues discussed by the Council of Europe in its recommendation cm/rec(2010)13 on profiling [4], as well as basic legal privacy principles enacted by the eu Data Protec- tion Directive 95/46/ec [5] and that affects profiles when they involve the storage and processing of personal data.
