\subsection{Task Execution Manager}
\subsubsection{Functionality and Features}
The TEM is tasked with coordinating the execution of tasks, especially those involving `offline' actions by peers and collectives. The TEM acts as a monitoring platform and interacts with the Orchestration Manager and Context Manager/Peer Manager. It takes tasks agreed from the OM and instantiates the required monitors with the CM.
For each task to be monitored the Execution Monitor requires as an input from the OM:
\begin{itemize} 
\item A description of the task whose execution has to be monitored; 
\item The IDs of the peers involved in the execution
\end{itemize}
At the same time the TEM will also have access to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensory data related to the peers involved in the execution (from the CM) and;
\item Mid and high-level data derived by sensor fusion in time and user input
\end{itemize}
Using these two sources the TEM produces an output to inform the OM of:
\begin{itemize}
\item The progress of a given tasks; and
\item Possible deviations that occur during the execution of this task; major deviations should be properly expressed to allow the OM to react in a timely manner.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Implementation}
The TEM is implemented in javascript using the node.js framework. Express is using for the REST API implementation and a MongoDB instance for storing data locally.

\subsubsection{Interfaces, Endpoints and Resources Exposed}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf GET /monitorTask} Get all the tasks which are being monitored by the TEM.
\item {\bf POST /monitorTask} Starts monitoring the execution of an agreed task by instantiating the relevant monitors. 
\item {\bf PUT /updateMonitor/:taskID} update the monitor of a task in TEM.
\item {\bf DELETE /terminateTaskMonitor/:taskID} Terminate the monitoring of a task.
\item {\bf GET /terminatedTasks} Get the list of all the terminated tasks.
\end{itemize}
