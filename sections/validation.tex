The final goal of validation activity is to test the ability of the platform to meet the high-level requirements %of the platform were 
described and analysed in detail in~\cite{D8.1}. In Table~\ref{tab:req} we summarize the achievements of the platform development in terms of ability to meet the requirements identified by the Consortium.

As it can be seen, most of the requirements, but not all, have been met. In particular, the following shortcomings have been identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item Platform usability: The PF is the entry point for developers to access the toolkit functionality. As its implementation is still under way (will be completed by M48, as per DoW), its ability to harness the complexity of the SmartSociety platform is still to be validated.
\item Privacy and security: Initially one of the key aspect was expected to be the ability by the users to define access control policies to personal information. As this feature was not relevant for any of the case studies and scenarios identified its priority in terms of implementation was downscaled throughout the project. 
\item Governance: in~\cite{D1.2} we discussed platform enablers for supporting a fair governance of the platform. As this feature was not relevant for any of the case studies and scenarios identified its priority in terms of implementation was downscaled throughout the project. 
\end{itemize}

Validation has been achieved by developing and deploying applications running on the platform. Throughout the project, two main applications have been used:
\begin{itemize}
\item SmartShare: a ride-sharing application targeting localised communities of users and able to match user preferences thanks to advanced artificial intelligence methods. 
\item AskSmartSociety!: a hybrid Q\&A application whereby answers to questions posed by users are based upon a combination of Web-powered machine peers and subject matter experts.
\end{itemize}
SmartShare uses the resources exposed by the OM, the PM, the PS, the RM, the CM and the TEM. It was used in a number of small-scale pilots at the Consortium partners' site and is now being piloted with various municipalities in Italy by IMA.
AskSmartSociety! uses the resources exposed by the OM, the PM, the IS and SmartCom. Thanks to its flexibility it was widely used to fork lab-scale applications (see examples in~\cite{D8.3}).
Both applications used the monitoring component.
%As it can be seen, not all requirements have been met yet, in most cases as they refer to components which are still not fully completed within the respective workpackage. Yet, the platform in its current version already provides the minimum level of functionality required to handle a rather large range of social computations, as demonstrated by the available demo applications.

% We now move to briefly describing the validation and testing activities carried out within the scope of Task T8.4 ('Lab experiments and platform validation'). These were based on the flexible AskSmartSociety! application developed in year-2 and presented in~\cite{D8.2} and included the development of a number of small-scale prototypes aimed at testing the flexibility and extensibility of the platform. In particular, the following two results were achieved:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bfseries Image tagging application:} based on the AskSmartSociety! application, a simple image tagging application was carried out. By means of such an application participants can post an image through the Ask! mobile application and ask other participants to provide tags annotating the image content. Other participants can tag the image using the Reply! application or the SmartSociety twitter peer. Tags are collected in the AskSmartSociety! peer, where they are disambiguated (using a third-party semantic analysis engine), ranked and finally the most likely tags are reported back to the user. The development required minimal modifications of the Ask! and Reply! application, integration with a third-party service for entity extraction~\footnote{\url{https://dandelion.eu/}} and a third-party service for image storage~\footnote{\url{http://imgur.com/}}.
% \item {\bfseries Facebook Peer and AskSmartSociety! Integration:} we developed a Facebook peer, in the form of a Facebook application connected to the SmartSociety platform. The integration was carried out for the AskSmartSociety! application. In this case, as it was for the Twitter peer, questions asked through the Ask! application get posted on the Facebook app page. Users who subscribed to the application can reply to the question using the `comment' Facebook functionality. Additionally, users can `like' comments posted by other users, an information which may be used to rank answers. In the AskSmartSociety! peer, answers from the Facebook peer are collected and integrated with those coming from the Reply! mobile app and the Twitter live feed. 
% \end{itemize}
% The work carried out to realize the two prototypes highlighted a number of issues in the current version of the platform, in particular in terms of functionality and ease of use of the APIs exposed by the Peer Manager; a new set of APIs was released by WP4 accordingly.
